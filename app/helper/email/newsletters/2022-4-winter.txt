**New features**
- Blot can now extract thumbnails from video embeds in your post. This makes a big difference on templates which display thumbnails on their index page, like  the Reference, Photo and Portfolio templates.
- Blot now generates screenshot of link posts. The feature is optional, opt-in required for existing users, turned on by default for new ones. This means you get thumbnails, etc. for webloc posts.
- You can now download the source folders for the test sites used to [preview the templates](https://blot.im/templates).
- For institutions who are interested in using Blot as a teaching tool: we built the infrastructure required to create accounts for your students. Blot was trialed as a teaching tool.
- Added a new 'random entry' feature. If you add a link to '/random' on your site to your menu, you'll be redirected to a random entry each time you click.
- Added sync history and a live ticker for the changes being made to your folder to the client settings page on your dashboard.

**Changes**
- Improved the appearance of Maths set with KateX
- Improved the Portfolio template
- Updated the dependencies on which Blot depends to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
- Made tweaks to the dashboard and documentation, per tradition.
- Improved the Google Drive client: previously it would break when you moving a file from within your blog folder into a folder outside your blog folder but within Google Drive. Also, you can now connect multiple blogs to the same google drive account. 
- Updates dashboard URL scheme

**Bugs fixed**
- Generally improved the sync stability of the Dropbox client. It's rock solid now.
- Fixed an issue with duplicate URLs and Commento.
- You can now connect more than one blog to the same Google Drive account.
- Fixed various CSS bugs which surfaced when you adjusted the colors on the [Blog template](https://blot.im/templates/blog).
- Fixed CSS bugs which affected the [Magazine template](https://blot.im/templates/magazine) and prevented the pagination from working under certain circumstances.
- The wildcard certificate, which is used to secure traffic to all of Blot's subdomains, now properly renews itself automatically. Previously it required manual intervention.
- Emojis now appear correctly in text files sent by Blot. Our static file delivery server previouly neglected to set the character set header.

**Questions**
Here are a few recent questions which I liked from [Questions](https://blot.im/questions), a section of Blot's site where users can ask and answer questions.
- [Does Blot use Blot?](https://blot.im/questions/525)
- [Setting up GitHub with Blot and Obsidian](https://blot.im/questions/642)
- [Getting the first item in an entries array](https://blot.im/questions/577)
- [How to have page URLs which mirror folder structure?](https://blot.im/questions/578)

**Mistakes**

Not been as communicative, went through periods taking a break from email. Fortunately or unfortunately, I get too much email these days to really take time off. I need to think about hiring someone to help with these, if you have any experience or advice with this, please get in touch!

**Plans for this season**

We have begun work on iCloud client, which will mean you can use a folder in your iCloud drive to publish a blog. If you have emailed me about iCloud support in the past, you might have received a message from me saying 'We'd love to support iCloud but Apple doesn't offer the neccessary APIs'. Well [Jon](https://jon.bo/) came up with a cunning plan to make it work.

If you have any thoughts or questions about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
