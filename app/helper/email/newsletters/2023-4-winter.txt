**New features**
- Added some [new fonts](https://blot.im/examples/templates/fonts) to the font picker on the web template editor
- Added an option to preserve hard line breaks to the typography settings page of your site. By default, markdown collapses text before and after a single line break into one paragraph. 
- You can now sign up with PayPal

**Changes**
- Made some improvements to the template editor
- Local template editing is much more streamlined. It's now not possible to clobber a template you're editing on Blot's website with local template files.
- Increased the price for future customers to $5 per month. This has not affected existing customers in any way: you will continue to pay the same fee as usual.
- We updated Blot’s dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities and made tweaks to the dashboard and documentation, per tradition.

**Bugs fixed**
- You can now search [all questions](https://blot.im/questions)
- Screenshots generated for link posts now should have fonts loading correctly
- Images embedded from word Documents
