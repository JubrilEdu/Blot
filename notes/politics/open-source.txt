# Open source

## A partly moral and partly cynical decision to make Blot's source code public

Open source just feels good. It projects an aura of insouciance about money that is appealing. any of Blot's customers are technical: they like programming. audience, and I'm asking that audience to invest a good deal of their time and some of their money in a piece of software. A large fraction of that audience is sceptical of closed-source, proprietary software. So it makes business sense for me to make [Blot's source code](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Blot) available freely under the most permissive license possible. 

These aesthetic considerations, after all, are paramount.

## As a moral decision

Intellectual property as a legal regime has its costs and its benefits. Ideas are obviously free by default but sometimes there are advantages to setting up legal defenses. But generally I think this has gone too far in our own culture and so I will not participate in it.

## Working in public

I also quite like the spectacle of working in public. I suspect it's reassuring to potential customers to see my  [git commits on the news page](https://blot.im/news), for them to know that Blot is  _alive_.

## Terminology

I like the ideals of the free software movement and I like Richard Stallman. However, I think the *free* part of Stallman's term *free software* is confusing. After starting too many explanations with *it's not free as in beer...* I've not to push against the current of popular usage. I'm also aware of the politics of the term 'open source', so I decide to side-step both and simply say _Blot's source code is dedicated to the public domain_.
